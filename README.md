## About this Respository 

This actually just started when I was looking for a potential projects for the [Gaming Like It's 1928](https://itch.io/jam/gaming-like-its-1928) game jam. I was curious what Canadian public domain works were available, but I found sometimes the repositories for Canadian works was very lack luster. With parrot laws to appease the elephant next door and people like Mike Harris **Ed: Who should be in jail for multiple reasons** defunding archives resulting in a giant loss of Canadian produced media. Also I am just curious how git works. 

## How this should work

Right now all works should be in a in markdown format with a YAML header,  if you pulled it from another public domain repository include that in the YAML. 

## Why Markdown 

Markdown is very future proof and can be converted into many formats, there are lots of software that can read and edit markdown.
